# EU4 and Stellaris WinXP fix
Patch for EU4 and Stellaris to work on Windows XP

## Supported games:
- EU4: 1.6.1 - 1.6.3
- Stellaris 1.0.0 - 1.0.2

## Works with:
- Codex;
- 3DM;
- SmartSteamEmu;

## Does not work with:
- SteamFix;

## How to use:
1. Get latest release here: https://github.com/UncleVasya/EU4_WinXP_fix/releases
2. Extract to the game folder;
3. Run xp_patch_EU4.cmd (or xp_patch_Stellaris.cmd);

## Note:
Steam might detect game .exe as corrupted after patching and block achievements, cloud saving, multiplayer etc.

If you experience issues with running game via Steam, you can un-bind game from Steam by using 1 of these ways:
- 3DM or Codex steam_api.dll;  <--- will allow only Singleplayer
- SmartEmu tools;  <--- will allow both Singleplayer and Multiplayer

If you don't know what any of above means, it is easier for you to get game installer from Russian fan-site (use Google Translate):
